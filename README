# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Prerequisites 
    + Anaconda 3.7+
    + Python 3.7+
    + Pip

## Installation 

Fork this [remote repository] (https://github.com/tbaroody10/rock-paper-scissors-game) under your own control, then "clone" or download your remote copy onto your local computer.

Then navigate there from the command line (subsequent commands assume you are running them from the local repository's root directory):

```sh
cd rock-paper-scissors-game
```

Use Anaconda to create and activate a new virtual environment, perhaps called "my-first-env":

```sh
conda create -n my-game-env python=3.8 # (first time only)
conda activate my-game-env
```

After activating the virtual environment, install package dependencies (see the ["requirements.txt"](/requirements.txt) file):


```sh
pip install python-dotenv
```

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> NOTE: if this command throws an error like "Could not open requirements file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory", make sure you are running it from the repository's root directory, where the requirements.txt file exists (see the initial `cd` step above).


## Setup

In the root directory of your local repository, create a new file called ".env", and update the contents of the ".env" file to specify your desired player name (then make sure to SAVE the ".env" file aftwards):

    PLAYER_NAME = "Tess Baroody" 


## Usage

From within the virtual environment, demonstrate your ability to run the Python script from the command line:

```sh
python game.py
```

> NOTE: if you see an error like "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '...'", it's because the given package isn't installed, so run the `pip` command above to ensure that package has been installed into the virtual environment.
